# slideshow-react

A basic slideshow made for React with styled-components.

## How to use

Download the project and run `npm install`. Then go to `/src/App.js`, and add / delete items inside the `const images`.

If you want to have more complex items, you can edit the page `/src/components/SlideshowContainer.js`, inside the `<SlideshowItem />` component.
